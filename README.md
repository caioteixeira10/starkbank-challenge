## Starkbank Challenge 

The code above is part of the Backend test as part of Starkbank evaluation process. The app was made using Flask, Python and swagger for the UI. I created two endpoints (/invoice and /transfer). Each one is for each task of the process. The /transfer endpoint will collect all invoices made in the last 24h made by /invoice endpoint and will make the transfer.
